## üíª How to Use

1.  **Save Your Friends:** In the "My Friends List" section, add the names of people you frequently share expenses with. This list is saved permanently.
2.  **Log an Expense:** Fill out the "Add Expense" form with the description, total amount, and who paid.
3.  **Select Participants:** Check the boxes next to the friends who were involved in *that specific expense*.
4.  **Choose Split Method:** Select whether to split the bill "Equally" or "Unequally". If you choose unequally, input boxes will appear for the selected participants.
5.  **View the Log:** The new expense will appear in the "Expenses Log". Click on it anytime to expand and view its specific breakdown.
6.  **Check the Final Summary:** The "Final Summary" card always shows the most efficient way for everyone to settle all outstanding debts.
7.  **Clear When Done:** When your trip or event is over, click "Clear All Expenses" in the Settings. This resets the expenses but keeps your master friends list safe for next time.
